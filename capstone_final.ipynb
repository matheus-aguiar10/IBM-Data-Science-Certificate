    "After plotting the 3 maps, first one only for Japanese Restaurants, second one for Italian Restaurants and the last one for the rest of kinds od restaurants, we got some insights that could help us and the stakeholders to take the decision. The questions for our problem are: Should I open an Japanese restaurant or an Italian restaurant? Where should I open it? \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first question, considering the competition and the type of food the city consumes, the option would be to open an Italian restaurant. First, competition is less and the distance between restaurants is greater. The concentration is not as great as that of a Japanese restaurant. Second, Italian food is among the 5 most consumed in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second question, if we are looking for a place to open a new restaurant, we have to consider the flow of people. There are a lot of companies located in the financial sector. During the week, monday to friday, the restaurants could sell more than the restaurants located Downtown. But considering the constancy of consumption, downtown would be the best option. First, there are few downtown Italian restaurant options and the distance between them is relatively large. Second, the financial district has a large volume of people during the week and on working days. If we take into account the holidays, and weekends, the volume of people and consumption there falls a lot. Another point is that, in addition to the normal flow of people downtown, tourists increase this even more. Few tourists visit the financial district. So the final decision would be to open an Italian restaurant downtown Toronto."
