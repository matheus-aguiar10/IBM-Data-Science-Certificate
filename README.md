# Data Science Professional Certificate - Final Project

In this project we will show some points that will help to find an optimal location for a new restaurant. The questions that we are looking for answers are: Should we open an Japanese restaurant or an Italian restaurant? Also, Where should we open it?

**1 - Data Source and Problem**

Centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Foursquare API. Based on our business problem, factors that will influence on our decision are:

- number of existing restaurants;

- number of and distance to Italian/Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood, if any;

- distance of the restaurant from city center or an location where is a large flow of people.
